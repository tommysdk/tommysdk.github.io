    <p>
        I'm a software professional with ~15 years of industry experience from a wide range of different industries and technology stacks. I have extensive experience of cutting-edge software engineering challenges and streamlining software development processes using lean, agile, continuous delivery and DevOps ways of working.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my software engineering career, I've specialized on developing quality software running on the Java platform. I'm an advocate of open source software, test-driven development, cloud computing, automation and tools that boost developer productivity and get software shipped faster. I've used those technologies to design, architect, engineer and deploy resilient and scalable systems capable of dealing with high load and low latency requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        I speak regularly on renowned international software conferences. I've spoken at e.g. Devoxx Belgium, JavaOne Latin America and Jfokus. I've also held lectures on test-driven development, continuous delivery and container technology with Docker for software engineering students at the Royal Institute of Technology. Co-founder of the Continuous Delivery Stockholm user group which has over 900 members.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contributed to various open source projects during my spare time, such as the Arquillian integration-testing framework, its sister project ShrinkWrap and the Apache TomEE application server. Committer and maintainer of the Jenkins Delivery Pipeline plugin for 5 years, with over 9000 known installations world-wide, providing bug and security fixes, feature development, documentation and community support. Also made minor contributions to JBoss Application Server, Apache Cassandra and Apache Commons Beanutils. Arctic Code Vault contributor.
